OSX QUICKSTART GUIDE

≈≈≈ 1. django ≈≈≈

sudo python -m pip install Django==1.8.4



≈≈≈ 2. psycopg installation ≈≈≈

cd ...server/psycopg2-2.6.1

sudo make install

(might have to install some dependencies here?)



≈≈≈ 3. postgres app ≈≈≈

this is the easiest way I know to get a server up for dev purposes
download it and run it

notice that it opens up psql, you can create a new database with
the command documented here
http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/sql-createdatabase.html

or figure out the details of the database it runs by default and connect to that



≈≈≈ 4. configure settings file ≈≈≈

open the settings file
...server/cafe/cafe/settings.py

scroll down to DATABASES and configure for your database



≈≈≈ 5. make migrations ≈≈≈

cd ...server/cafe

run the following command

$ python manage.py migrate

this will create the proper tables in your database



≈≈≈ 6. run server ≈≈≈

run

$ python manage.py runserver

with any luck the server should now be running!

try it out at localhost:8000/admin
